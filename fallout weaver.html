			<p>Fallout is a post-apocalyptic drama television series based on the video game series of the same name. While sharing the setting of the franchise's mainline video games, the plot is that of an original story rather than retelling one from previous entries. The television series starts 219 years after the Great War of 2077. It details the lives of three main protagonists: Lucy MacLean, Squire Maximus, and The Ghoul.</p>
			
        <p>Ella Purnell plays Lucy from Vault 33, "an optimistic Vault-dweller with an all-American can-do spirit" and a "peaceful and idealistic nature," who sets out to the surface to rescue her father after his abduction by Raiders under the leadership of Lee Moldaver, portrayed by Sarita Choudhury Purne.l described her character as initially being "very optimistic, very naive and innocent" and her journey being about "about how much that changes when she comes up to the surface and interacts with the characters and experiences the chaos that is the wasteland."Aaron Moten takes the role of Maximus, an aspiring young soldier "in the militaristic faction called Brotherhood of Steel," who is willing to "do anything to further the Brotherhood’s goals of bringing law and order to the wasteland."Moten described his character as being "really torn between what is a pursuit of his own personal glory and rising in the ranks with the Brotherhood."</p>
			
        <p>Walton Goggins depicts The Ghoul, a former war veteran and Western actor who became a Ghoul, and turned into "a morally ambiguous bounty hunter who holds within him a 200-year history of the post-nuclear world." Casting Goggins for the role as a Ghoul was one of the first creative decisions by the two showrunners, Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner, with Goggins considering playing two roles at "two very different times in their life split up by a nuclear fallout" to be "complex and absurdist and satirical and subversive, which is right up my alley." Goggins also described his character as being "ruthless and pragmatic with his own kind of moral code" and as "devilishly handsome with a wicked sense of humor."Albeit for different reasons, each of the protagonists crosses paths as they pursue the same goal: to retrieve the decapitated head of Dr. Siggi Wilzig, which holds a powerful relic that "has the potential to radically change the power dynamic in this world.</p>
